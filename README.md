## 🎯 THE PROBLEM WITH MODERN PRODUCTION

You've heard it. That **same lead**. That **same bassline**. That **same preset** everyone downloaded from the same pack.

Your tracks sound professional, but they don't sound like **YOU**.

You're tired of:
- Digging through 10,000 presets that all sound the same
- Fighting with complicated synthesizers that kill your creative flow
- Settling for "close enough" because modulation routing is a nightmare
- Watching your unique ideas get buried under generic sounds

---

## 🔥 THE SOLUTION: NEGATIVE MATRIX

**Negative Matrix** isn't just another synthesizer. It's a creative weapon built specifically for **psytrance, techno, and experimental producers** who need sounds that stand out in a saturated market.

### 🎨 Design Philosophy

> "If your tools encourage you to sound like everyone else, you need better tools."

Negative Matrix was born in late-night studio sessions, crafted for one purpose: **to give you sounds that nobody else has access to.**

## ✨ CORE FEATURES

### 🌊 **4 Independent Oscillator Engines**
Each oscillator is a complete synthesis powerhouse with its own personality:
- **5 Waveforms**: Sine, Saw, Square, Triangle, Sample & Hold
- **50Hz - 5kHz Range**: Perfect for sub-bass to screaming leads
- **Individual Processing**: Each osc has its own filter, envelope, LFO, delay, and effects

### 🎛️ **The Modulation Matrix (The Secret Weapon)**
This is where magic happens. Route **any LFO to any parameter** with bipolar modulation:
- **Sources**: 4 independent LFOs (one per oscillator)
- **Targets**: Frequency, Cutoff, Resonance, Delay Time, Delay Amount
- **Depth**: -100% to +100% (negative values for inverted modulation)
- **Multiple Connections**: One LFO can control multiple parameters simultaneously

**Real Talk**: This is the feature that makes your sounds **unmistakably yours**. While others are clicking through presets, you're designing movement and life from scratch.

### 🎚️ **5-Stage Filter System**
Professional filters that actually respond musically:
- **Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass, Notch, Comb**
- **100Hz - 8kHz Range** with precision control
- **Resonance 0.1 - 2.0**: From subtle to screaming self-oscillation
- **Real-time Spectrum Analyzer**: See your filter curve as you tweak

### 📈 **ADSR Envelopes That Make Sense**
Responsive, musical envelopes for each oscillator:
- **Attack/Decay/Release**: 1-5000ms (yes, FIVE SECONDS)
- **Sustain**: 0-100% with smooth transitions
- **Retriggerable**: Perfect for rhythmic psytrance patterns
- **Global or Individual Control**: Trigger all oscs or just one

### 💫 **Psychedelic Effects Suite**
Built-in effects designed specifically for psychedelic and electronic music:

#### **Psy Distortion**
Three waveshaping algorithms for harmonic enhancement:
- **Soft**: Warm, musical saturation (perfect for basslines)
- **Hard**: Aggressive clipping for industrial sounds
- **Tube**: Exponential curve warmth (analog character)
- **Drive**: 1.0-10.0 intensity control

#### **Psy Chorus**
Three-voice modulated delay for spatial depth:
- **Mix**: 0-100% wet/dry balance
- **Rate**: 0.1-5.0 Hz modulation speed
- **Depth**: 0-100% modulation intensity
- **120° Phase Offset**: Natural, wide stereo field

#### **Psy Gate**
BPM-synchronized rhythmic amplitude modulation:
- **Depth**: 0-100% gate intensity
- **Rate**: 1-32 (from whole notes to 32nd notes)
- **16-Step Pattern**: Pre-programmed full-on psytrance pattern `[1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1]`

#### **FM Synthesis**
Classic frequency modulation for complex timbres:
- **Amount**: 0-100% modulation depth
- **Ratio**: 0.1-8.0 (carrier:modulator)

#### **Forest Noise**
Random burst generator for organic textures:
- **Amount**: 0-100% noise level
- Perfect for psytrance forest atmospheres

### 🔄 **Advanced LFO System**
Four independent LFOs with powerful sync capabilities:

**Two Operating Modes:**
- **Hz Mode**: Direct frequency control (0.1-20 Hz)
- **Sync Mode**: Tempo-locked to master BPM

**Sync Divisions:**
- 1/1 (whole notes) → 1/16 (sixteenth notes)
- Perfect for creating evolving, rhythmic modulations

**Pro Tip**: Use different LFO rates on different oscillators for polyrhythmic complexity that makes tracks feel alive.

### 🎹 **Intelligent Arpeggiator**
8-step programmable arpeggiator with:
- **Per-Step Semitone Offset**: -24 to +24 semitones
- **Per-Step Octave Transpose**: -4 to +4 octaves
- **Hz or Sync Mode**: Free-running or tempo-locked
- **Real-time Pattern Editing**: Changes apply immediately

### ⏱️ **Per-Oscillator Delay**
Individual delay for each oscillator:
- **Amount**: 0-100% (feedback control)
- **Time**: 10-1000ms
- **Applications**: Echo, doubling, reverb simulation, rhythmic effects

### 📊 **Real-Time Visualization**
Professional-grade visual feedback:

**Oscilloscope (Left Panel)**
- Live waveform display
- 1024 sample buffer (~23ms at 44.1kHz)
- 20Hz refresh rate
- Full 32-bit float precision

**Filter Spectrum Analyzer (Right Panel)**
- Real-time frequency response
- Color-coded cutoff markers for all oscillators
- Logarithmic scale (10Hz - 22kHz)
- -60dB to 0dB magnitude range

### 💾 **Comprehensive Preset System**
Save and recall your entire creative state:
- **JSON Format**: Human-readable, easy to share
- **Complete State Capture**: Every parameter, every modulation connection
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Instant Loading**: No confirmation popups (coming in next update)
- **Included Presets**: Danger, Forest, Deep, and more

## 🎓 ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### **Polyrhythmic Modulation**
Use different LFO sync divisions across oscillators:
- OSC1: LFO synced to 1/4 notes
- OSC2: LFO synced to 1/6 notes (triplets)
- OSC3: LFO synced to 1/8 notes
- **Result**: Complex, evolving patterns that never repeat the same way

### **Negative Modulation for Counterpoint**
Route the same LFO to multiple parameters with opposite polarities:
- LFO1→OSC1_CUTOFF at +60%
- LFO1→OSC1_RESONANCE at -40%
- **Result**: As filter opens, resonance decreases (natural, musical movement)

### **Layered Movement**
Stack modulations for intricate evolution:
- LFO1→OSC1_FREQ at +10% (slow pitch drift)
- LFO2→OSC1_CUTOFF at +80% (filter sweep)
- LFO3→OSC1_DELAY_TIME at +50% (rhythmic delay modulation)
- **Result**: Three-dimensional movement that keeps listeners engaged

### **Spectral Stacking**
Create rich, evolving tones with harmonic relationships:
- OSC1: 220Hz (fundamental)
- OSC2: 440Hz (octave)
- OSC3: 660Hz (perfect fifth)
- OSC4: 880Hz (two octaves)
- **Apply different LFO rates to each oscillator's cutoff**
- **Result**: Evolving harmonic complexity, sounds huge and unique
